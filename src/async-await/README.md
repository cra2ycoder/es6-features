## Async

-   Async -> Asynchronous
-   which returns `AsyncFunction` Object
-   operates via `event loop`

## life cycle

-   `await` pauses the `async` function execution
-   wait for `Promise` resolution either `resolve` or `reject`
-   once after response received from the `Promise`
-   resumes the `async` function
-   `returns` the value
