# Destructuring

- its a cool feature from ES6
- its an javascript expression
- that helps to unpack the values from Array and Object - to distinct variables

# Array

```
// ES6
const [a, b, c, d, ...rest] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];
```

```
// ES5
var a = 1,
    b = 2,
    c = 3,
    d = 4,
    rest = [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];
```
