- run the following command in your CLI/Terminal

```
npm init

- answer those questions

**setup for es6 compiling**

_basically, most of the browser are not supporting to compile the es6 code as of now, so we required to have one transpile to compile our code from es6 to es5 standards. Babel is one of most javascript compiler which used by millions of developers in the world._

- run the following command to install babel in local
  - https://babeljs.io/setup#installation
  - https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-cli/

* via npm:

```
npm install --save-dev @babel/core @babel/cli
```

_note: install with npm only, since yarn skips to including @babel/core_

- add babel scripts in `package.json` file to compile

```
"scripts": {
    "build": "babel src -d lib"
},
```

- create `src` directory
- add files that you wanted to compile and see the results
- after, run the following command

* via package.json:

```
npm run build
```

- direct terminal command

```
./node_modules/.bin/babel src -d lib
```

**Hold ON! You have successfully installed Babel! But, there are two more steps pending! since current installation done with nothing!**

_Actually, babel presets plugin require to be added for transforming the code from es6 syntax to es5 standards_

- run the following command to install

```
npm install @babel/preset-env --save-dev
```

- create `.babelrc` file, in your root directory
- to enable preset transformation, please add the following code in `.babelrc` file

```
{
  "presets": ["@babel/preset-env"]
}
```
